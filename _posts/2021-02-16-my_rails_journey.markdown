Starting Rails has probably been the most exiting part of this whole adventure so far. While I have enjoyed everything I've learned up to this point I was really excited to start writing what felt like real world code. Now this section has been the by far the most difficult, but I believe in way the difficulty helped cement my desire to learn Software Dev. During this project I've been forced to sit down and manage my time better, and also learn new ways to approach errors. My project is a simple scheduling app that allows users to create, edit, and delete shifts. I chose this idea because eventually I would like to grow this app into something that could be used by EMS agencies. This idea is something that is close to home for me due to my background, and my plan is to continue working on it in my free time.
