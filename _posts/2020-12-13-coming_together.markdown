At this point I am about halfway through the program and things are really beginning to make sense. At the beginning of this program I was extremley nervous about what was ahead and wasn't too confident that I would have what it takes to make it through this program. While this project was very challenging I really do feel like the fundamentals are starting to stick. I still have a long way to go, but I'm even more excited now for what is to come. 

The Project

From the start I knew what I wanted to build. I wanted an app that would allow you to create an inventory list for your bags. This comes from my time in EMS where we had to do inventory every morning, and wanted to build something that could relate to that part of life. The app allows users to Sign Up or Sign In and create/edit/delete their own bags, and also allows them to see bags created by other users. The trickey part was to allow users to see all the bags while only allowing them to edit/delete their own bags. As of now I don't feel completely done with my project there are still a few minor things I would like to do to make the user experiance more enjoyable, but I am very happy with what I have created so far.
