At the beginning of this project I was a bit apprehensive about my ability to create a CLI from scratch on my own. I started with listing out what I wanted to accomplish with my program. I wanted to be able to search a city and get a list of breweries and a snippit of information for each brewery. It seemed simple enough and after taking some time to find an API I was ready to start writing my code. My patience was tested, and more than once it made me question if I really had the knowledge and ability to write this program. Little by little I was able to push through the blocks and build a functioning CLI, and when it finally all came together I was greeted with a rush of excitement. I cant wait to see what the rest of this year has in store, and I more excited now than ever to see where this journey is going to take me.
