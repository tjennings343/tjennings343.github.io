My reason why is very simple, I want a career that will challange me on a daily basis and give me the oppurtunity to create. For the better part of my life I have worked in the public safety field or in the military, and I have always enjoyed the challange of not knowing what my day will bring. I left the military three years ago and I have struggled to find a career path that was challanging enough to keep me excited to come to work. I bounced around from idea to idea until one day I found programming. After spending hours trying to learn simple code I became hooked. I love how the world of coding is always changing, and there is always more to learn. I am extremely excited to begin my classes here at Flatiron School, and I can't wait to see what this year has to bring.
